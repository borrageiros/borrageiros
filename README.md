## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a highly motivated person with a deep passion for computer science.  
I have experience with various programming languages, including **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Bash, and SQL**.  
I also possess strong knowledge of **HTML and CSS**, and I’ve developed small projects using **C# and PHP**.

I regularly work with modern frameworks and technologies such as **React, Svelte, NestJS, Next.js, Express, Node.js, and Vite**.

I have experience in both frontend and backend development, with a particular preference for the latter.  
I’ve worked with relational databases (**MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite**) and non-relational databases (**MongoDB, Redis, Firebase, Cassandra**).

I'm also proficient in automation and scripting tasks, using **Bash, Python, and CLI tools** to optimize workflows and deployments. ⚙️
